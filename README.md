## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the **Tandemloop First Screening Test**.  
The objective of this test is to demonstrate core problem-solving ability, understanding of basic programming logic, and clean code design using **Java**.

Each problem in this repository covers a different aspect of programming such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Loops and Conditional Logic  
- Data Structures (Arrays, Maps)  
- Modular Code Organization  
- Input/Output Handling

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to set up and run the programs on your local system.

### 🧩 Step 1: Install Java
Check if Java is already installed:
```bash
java --version
javac --version

```

If not installed, download and install the latest **JDK** from [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Clone This Repository

Use Git to clone this project to your local system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tandemloop-Screening-Test.git
```

Then navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd Tandemloop-Screening-Test
```

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Compile the Java Files

Compile each Java file using:

```bash
javac Problem_1.java
javac Problem_2.java
javac Problem_3.java
javac Problem_4.java
```

---

### 🧩 Step 4: Run the Programs

Execute any program with:

```bash
java Problem-1
```

(Replace `Problem_1` with the respective file name.)

## 🧠 Working Principle of Each Problem

### 🧮 Problem-1: Calculator

* Implements a **Calculator class** to perform arithmetic operations.
* Takes two numeric inputs and an operation type.
* Uses methods like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.

**Concepts Used:** Classes, Methods, User Input, Switch-case Logic

---

### 🔢 Problem-2: Series Generator (1, 3, 5, 7, …)

* Generates an **odd number series** up to a user-specified limit.
* Demonstrates **loop control** and **incremental logic**.

**Concepts Used:** Loops, Conditional Increment, Output Formatting

---

### 🔄 Problem-3: Conditional Series (Even/Odd Based)

* Generates a numeric sequence based on whether the input is **even or odd**.
* If input is even → one pattern; if odd → another pattern.

**Concepts Used:** Conditional Statements, Loop Control, Modular Arithmetic

---

### 🧮 Problem-4: Count Multiples

* Takes a list of integers and counts how many are **multiples of 1–9**.
* Uses **maps** to store counts for each number efficiently.

**Concepts Used:** Arrays, HashMap, Loop Iteration, Modulus Operator

---

## ▶️ Example Execution

```bash
javac Problem_1.java
java Problem_1
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (add/subtract/multiply/divide): multiply
Result: 50
```
